Hello! Here are the results of a training set based on the DeepH method, along with plotting operations. The Excel spreadsheet contains fundamental data for all generated graphene, including Hamiltonian, electrical conductivity, density of states, etc.

The training dataset is automatically obtained through the included Python script. You can refer to get_dataset.py for more details.

This project is a derivative of the DeepH method. If you wish to explore the original method and understand the current status of the original research group, please visit the following website:
